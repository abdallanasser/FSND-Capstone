# FSND-Capstone
Final Project for the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree 

## Overview

This project consists of a Casting Agency App.
The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.
The goal of this project is to practice and get a better insight of how full stack delevoping is.

## Motivation for project

This project sums up all the effort made during this Nanodregree where I learned many different technologies and the basics of how FE and BE interact with each other.
I believe this project is the stepping stone that will allow me to dive into the deepths of the web development world and I'm really exited to get this jorney started as a Full Stack Developer.
The project itself will definetly have a lot of potential improvements, but that's what developing means for me, always having room for making things better, more efficient and simpler.
